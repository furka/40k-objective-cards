- Manually input scores if you prefer to roll physical dic. Alternatively you can let the app roll for you by entering values like so `d3 + 3`.
- Manually pick cards from your deck. Alternatively you can let the app draw them at random for you.
- Uses session storage. As long as you keep your browser tab open, you won't loose progress by refreshing the page. This means you can also keep track of separate players by keeping multiple tabs open.
